# Data Integration and Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involved integrating data from two sources, an Excel file (`buffer.xlsx`) and a CSV file (`temp.csv`), into Pandas DataFrames for analysis. As a beginner, I encountered various challenges and successfully navigated through them, achieving valuable insights through data processing and visualization.

## Phases and Challenges

### 1. Loading the Data
**Loading the data -** Initially, loading data from different formats (Excel and CSV) was daunting, especially considering encoding issues. Using Pandas' `pd.read_excel()` and `pd.read_csv()` functions, I successfully imported the datasets after consulting examples and Pandas documentation.

### 2. Inspecting the Data
**Inspecting the data -** Understanding the data structure was overwhelming due to varied formats and numerous columns. Methods like `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()` helped me grasp the data's composition, columns, and data types.

### 3. Standardizing Column Names
**Standardizing column names -** The datasets had inconsistent column names (varying cases, spaces, and different names for similar data). I utilized `str.lower()` and `str.replace()` to standardize column names by converting them to lowercase and replacing spaces with underscores for uniformity.

### 4. Handling Missing Values
**Handling missing values -** Addressing missing values, particularly in the `credits_issued` column, was crucial without compromising analysis. I used `fillna()` to replace missing values with 0, ensuring accurate sum calculations. Additionally, I initialized the `vintage` column with empty strings for potential future data integration.

### 5. Ensuring Consistent Data Types
**Ensuring consistent data types -** The `credits_issued` column presented mixed data types, causing calculation errors. Employing `pd.to_numeric()` with `errors='coerce'` helped convert non-numeric values to `NaN`, subsequently filled with 0 for consistency.

### 6. Merging DataFrames
**Merging DataFrames -** Combining datasets into a single DataFrame was challenging due to different columns. Using `pd.concat()`, I merged the DataFrames along rows, leveraging standardized columns for seamless integration.

### 7. Performing Basic Analysis
**Performing basic analysis -** Initially confusing, grouping data by `project_type`, `country`, and `vintage` to compute total credits issued was achieved using Pandas' `groupby()` and `sum()` functions. Examples and documentation were instrumental in mastering these operations.

### 8. Creating Visualizations
**Creating visualizations -** Generating insightful visualizations proved intricate. I explored Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries, creating bar plots for total credits by `project_type` and `country`, along with a histogram of credits issued. Adjustments like figure size and label rotation were refined through trial and error.

## Conclusion
This project provided invaluable learning experiences, overcoming challenges through research, experimentation, and persistence. Witnessing the final results and visualizations was gratifying, highlighting the journey from initial hurdles to insightful data analysis.
